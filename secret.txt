Confidential Briefing Document â€“ Internal Use Only

Project: AirGapQR Phase 1
Date: June 2025
Classification Level: TOP SECRET

Summary:
The AirGapQR system enables secure data transfer between air-gapped systems using only visual QR code transmission. It bypasses all traditional network vectors including USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

Encryption:
All files are encrypted using Fernet (AES-128 CBC mode with HMAC integrity), then Base64-encoded and chunked to fit within QR code capacity limits (~1000 characters per code). This ensures both compatibility and data integrity during transfer.

Use Case:
This system is ideal for military, intelligence, and emergency secure communications in environments where network access is considered untrustworthy or unavailable.

Handling:
This document and the system it describes must only be used in authorized, controlled environments. Loss, leakage, or unauthorized reproduction of this data may result in serious breach of security protocols and compromise of operations.

Authorized Personnel Only.
